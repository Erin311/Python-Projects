IntroductionTip: Quoted sections like this will provide helpful instructions on how to navigate and use a Jupyter notebook.Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.Posing QuestionsBefore looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how you would want to use the service?Question 1: Write at least two questions related to bike sharing that you think could be answered by data.Answer: What areas of each city are in most demand? What days of the week are most in demand? How many casual users become subscribers? How often do bikes have to be replenished at each "station"?Tip: If you double click on this cell, you will see the text change so that all of the formatting is removed. This allows you to edit this block of text. This block of text is written using Markdown, which is a way to format text using headers, links, italics, and many other options using a plain-text syntax. You will also use Markdown later in the Nanodegree program. Use Shift + Enter or Shift + Return to run the cell and show its rendered form.Data Collection and WranglingNow it's time to collect and explore our data. In this project, we will focus on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities has a page where we can freely download the trip data.:New York City (Citi Bike): LinkChicago (Divvy): LinkWashington, DC (Capital Bikeshare): LinkIf you visit these pages, you will notice that each city has a different way of delivering its data. Chicago updates with new data twice a year, Washington DC is quarterly, and New York City is monthly. However, you do not need to download the data yourself. The data has already been collected for you in the /data/ folder of the project files. While the original data for 2016 is spread among multiple files for each city, the files in the /data/ folder collect all of the trip data for the year into one file per city. Some data wrangling of inconsistencies in timestamp format within each city has already been performed for you. In addition, a random 2% sample of the original data is taken to make the exploration more manageable.Question 2: However, there is still a lot of data for us to investigate, so it's a good idea to start off by looking at one entry from each of the cities we're going to analyze. Run the first code cell below to load some packages and functions that you'll be using in your analysis. Then, complete the second code cell to print out the first trip recorded from each of the cities (the second line of each data file).Tip: You can run a code cell like you formatted Markdown cells above by clicking on the cell and using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter or Shift + Return. Alternatively, a code cell can be executed using the Play button in the toolbar after selecting it. While the cell is running, you will see an asterisk in the message to the left of the cell, i.e. In [*]:. The asterisk will change into a number to show that execution has completed, e.g. In [1]. If there is output, it will show up as Out [1]:, with an appropriate number to match the "In" number.In [25]:## import all necessary packages and functions.

If everything has been filled out correctly, you should see below the printout of each city name (which has been parsed from the data file name) that the first trip has been parsed in the form of a dictionary. When you set up a DictReader object, the first row of the data file is normally interpreted as column names. Every other row in the data file will use those column names as keys, as a dictionary is generated for each row.This will be useful since we can refer to quantities by an easily-understandable label instead of just a numeric index. For example, if we have a trip stored in the variable row, then we would rather get the trip duration from row['duration'] instead of row[0].Condensing the Trip DataIt should also be observable from the above printout that each city provides different information. Even where the information is the same, the column names and formats are sometimes different. To make things as simple as possible when we get to the actual exploration, we should trim and clean the data. Cleaning the data makes sure that the data formats across the cities are consistent, while trimming focuses only on the parts of the data we are most interested in to make the exploration easier to work with.You will generate new data files with five values of interest for each trip: trip duration, starting month, starting hour, day of the week, and user type. Each of these may require additional wrangling depending on the city:Duration: This has been given to us in seconds (New York, Chicago) or milliseconds (Washington). A more natural unit of analysis will be if all the trip durations are given in terms of minutes.Month, Hour, Day of Week: Ridership volume is likely to change based on the season, time of day, and whether it is a weekday or weekend. Use the start time of the trip to obtain these values. The New York City data includes the seconds in their timestamps, while Washington and Chicago do not. The datetime package will be very useful here to make the needed conversions.User Type: It is possible that users who are subscribed to a bike-share system will have different patterns of use compared to users who only have temporary passes. Washington divides its users into two types: 'Registered' for users with annual, monthly, and other longer-term subscriptions, and 'Casual', for users with 24-hour, 3-day, and other short-term passes. The New York and Chicago data uses 'Subscriber' and 'Customer' for these groups, respectively. For consistency, you will convert the Washington labels to match the other two.Question 3a: Complete the helper functions in the code cells below to address each of the cleaning tasks described above.In [27]:from datetime import datetime

Question 4c: Dig deeper into the question of trip duration based on ridership. Choose one city. Within that city, which type of user takes longer rides on average: Subscribers or Customers?Answer: In Chicago there are more Subscibers than Customers but those Customers tend to take longer rides. 12 minutes for Subscribers vs 31 minutes for Customers.In [40]:## Use this and additional cells to answer Question 4c.

VisualizationsThe last set of values that you computed should have pulled up an interesting result. While the mean trip time for Subscribers is well under 30 minutes, the mean trip time for Customers is actually above 30 minutes! It will be interesting for us to look at how the trip times are distributed. In order to do this, a new library will be introduced here, matplotlib.

In the above cell, we collected fifty trip times in a list, and passed this list as the first argument to the .hist() function. This function performs the computations and creates plotting objects for generating a histogram, but the plot is actually not rendered until the .show() function is executed. The .title() and .xlabel() functions provide some labeling for plot context.You will now use these functions to create a histogram of the trip times for the city you selected in question 4c. Don't separate the Subscribers and Customers for now: just collect all of the trip times and plot them.In [44]:## Use this and additional cells to collect all of the trip times as a list ##
## and then use pyplot functions to generate a histogram of trip times.     ##

plt.hist(duration)

plt.xlabel('Duration (m)')
plt.show()
If you followed the use of the .hist() and .show() functions exactly like in the example, you're probably looking at a plot that's completely unexpected. The plot consists of one extremely tall bar on the left, maybe a very short second bar, and a whole lot of empty space in the center and right. Take a look at the duration values on the x-axis. This suggests that there are some highly infrequent outliers in the data. Instead of reprocessing the data, you will use additional parameters with the .hist() function to limit the range of data that is plotted. Documentation for the function can be found [here].Question 5: Use the parameters of the .hist() function to plot the distribution of trip times for the Subscribers in your selected city. Do the same thing for only the Customers. Add limits to the plots so that only trips of duration less than 75 minutes are plotted. As a bonus, set the plots up so that bars are in five-minute wide intervals. For each group, where is the peak of each distribution? How would you describe the shape of each distribution?Answer: Subscriber trip durations peak at the 5-10 minute mark. Customers peak at the 20-25 minute mark. Both distributions are skewed slightly to the right but the Customer group is a bit more normally distributed than the Subscriber group.In [45]:## Use this and additional cells to answer Question 5. ##

Out[46]:Text(0.5,0,'Duration(m)')Performing Your Own AnalysisSo far, you've performed an initial exploration into the data available. You have compared the relative volume of trips made between three U.S. cities and the ratio of trips made by Subscribers and Customers. For one of these cities, you have investigated differences between Subscribers and Customers in terms of how long a typical trip lasts. Now it is your turn to continue the exploration in a direction that you choose. Here are a few suggestions for questions to explore:How does ridership differ by month or season? Which month / season has the highest ridership? Does the ratio of Subscriber trips to Customer trips change depending on the month or season?Is the pattern of ridership different on the weekends versus weekdays? On what days are Subscribers most likely to use the system? What about Customers? Does the average duration of rides change depending on the day of the week?During what time of day is the system used the most? Is there a difference in usage patterns for Subscribers and Customers?If any of the questions you posed in your answer to question 1 align with the bullet points above, this is a good opportunity to investigate one of them. As part of your investigation, you will need to create a visualization. If you want to create something other than a histogram, then you might want to consult the Pyplot documentation. In particular, if you are plotting values across a categorical variable (e.g. city, user type), a bar chart will be useful. The documentation page for .bar() includes links at the bottom of the page with examples for you to build off of for your own use.Question 6: During what time of day is the system used the most?Answer: I expected the weekends to have considerable more activity than during the week. As the data shows, that is not the case. While the middle of the week does appear to be slightly less busy, Monday is actually the day of the highest traffic in Chicago and Wednesday is the highest in NYC. In Chicago Saturday, Sunday, and Wednesday have the lowest number of rentals which very much suprised me. In NYC Friday, Saturday, and Sunday have the lowest. Either way my "guess" of what the data would produce proved to be false.In [47]:import pandas as pd

ConclusionsCongratulations on completing the project! This is only a sampling of the data analysis process: from generating questions, wrangling the data, and to exploring the data. Normally, at this point in the data analysis process, you might want to draw conclusions about the data by performing a statistical test or fitting the data to a model for making predictions. There are also a lot of potential analyses that could be performed on the data which are not possible with only the data provided. For example, detailed location data has not been investigated. Where are the most commonly used docks? What are the most common routes? As another example, weather has potential to have a large impact on daily ridership. How much is ridership impacted when there is rain or snow? Are subscribers or customers affected more by changes in weather?
